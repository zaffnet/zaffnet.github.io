Hello World!

I am Zafarullah Mahmood. I live in [New Delhi](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/New+Delhi,+Delhi/@28.5272181,77.0688997,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x390cfd5b347eb62d:0x52c2b7494e204dce!8m2!3d28.6139391!4d77.2090212) and am doing [B. Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology) from [Jamia Millia Islamia](http://jmi.ac.in/).

I am an [open source](https://opensource.org/) enthusiast and currently in love with [Python](https://www.python.org/).

I did my [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) in Fall 2014. My [Deep Learning](http://deeplearning.net/) journey started with [Andrew Ng](https://g.co/kgs/LncD2h)'s [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Course on Coursera. [Andrej Karpathy](https://g.co/kgs/VPCiQg)'s [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) (Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition) and [Richard Socher](http://www.socher.org/)'s [CS224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) (Deep Learning for NLP) proved very helpful in understanding the nuts and bolts of DNNs. During the summer of 2016, I assisted my professor in analyzing various RNN architectures for [Automatic Text Summarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization) while doing an internship at [Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, JMI](http://jmi.ac.in/aboutjamia/centres/innovationentr-epreneurship/contactus).

I am interested in [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), [Visual Recognition](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition/) and [Natural Langauge Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). I like to share my knowledge and experience through talks and lectures. I am the course instructor and moderator at [SCONJ Hour of Code](http://sconj.org/), an endeavor to inculcate a coding culture among Freshmen at Jamia Millia Islamia. I also participate in various [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions.
